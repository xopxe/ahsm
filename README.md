# ahsm: a Hierarchical State Machine

ahsm is a very small and simple implementation of Hierarchical State Machines, also known as Statecharts. It's written in Lua, with no external dependencies, and in a single file. Can be run on platforms as small as a microcontroller. The API is inspired by the xFSM library.

See test.lua for an example on utilization.

THE LIBRARY IS VERY ALPHA QUALITY, AND HAS NOT BEEN TESTED, EXTENSIVELLY OR OTHERWISE.
